Now it works with anything!

Maybe that's not so good? Let's set it to one address:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:1111

var handleCors = function(req, res, next) {
  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:1111');
  next();
};

Let's make two clients one at port :1111, and another at :2222

will :2222 work? HELL NO!
